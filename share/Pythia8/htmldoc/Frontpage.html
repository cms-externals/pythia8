<h1>PYTHIA 8</h1> 
 
<h2>Welcome to PYTHIA - The Lund Monte Carlo!</h2> 
 
<p/> 
PYTHIA 8 is the successor to PYTHIA 6, rewritten from scratch in C++. 
At the release of the first public version, 8.100, it was untried and 
also still missed a few relevant features. This has changed over the 
years since then, and the release of 8.200 marks the end of a transition 
period. PYTHIA 8.2 has a significantly extended physics scope, notably 
for LHC physics, relative to what PYTHIA 6.4 could offer. There are only 
a few areas left, such as &gamma;&gamma; physics, where 6.4 still has a 
role to fill. 
 
<h2>Documentation</h2> 
 
On these webpages you will find the up-to-date manual for PYTHIA 8.2. 
Use the left-hand index to navigate this documentation of program 
elements, especially of all possible program settings. All parameters 
are provided with sensible default values, however, so you need only 
change those of relevance to your particular study, such as choice of 
beams, processes and phase space cuts. The pages also contain a fairly 
extensive survey of all methods available to the user, e.g. to study 
the produced events. What is lacking on these webpages is an overview, 
on the one hand, and an in-depth physics description, on the other. 
 
<p/> 
The overview can be found in the attached PDF file 
<br/><a href="../pdfdoc/pythia8200.pdf" target="page"> 
<b>An Introduction to PYTHIA 8.2</b></a> 
<br/>T. Sj&ouml;strand et al, Comput. Phys.Commun. 191 (2015) 159 
[arXiv:1410.3012 [hep-ph]]. 
<br/>You are strongly recommended to read this summary when you 
start out to learn how to use PYTHIA 8.2. 
 
<p/> 
For the physics description we refer to the complete 
<br/><b>PYTHIA 6.4 Physics and Manual</b> 
<br/>T. Sj&ouml;strand, S. Mrenna and P. Skands, JHEP05 (2006) 026, 
<br/>which in detail describes the physics (largely) implemented also in 
PYTHIA 8, and also provides a more extensive bibliography than found 
here. When you use PYTHIA 8.2, you should therefore cite both. 
 
<p/> 
Furthermore, a separate 
<br/><a href="../pdfdoc/worksheet8200.pdf" target="page"> 
<b>PYTHIA 8.2 Worksheet</b></a>, 
<br/>also an attached PDF file, offers a practical introduction to 
using the generator. It has been developed for and used at a few 
summer schools, with minor variations, but is also suited for 
self-study.
